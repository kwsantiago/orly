## Performance Summary

### Publishing Performance

| Metric | Best Result | Test Configuration |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Peak Event Rate** | 21,118.66 events/sec | 50 concurrent publishers, 512-byte events |
| **Peak Bandwidth** | 198.28 MB/sec | 10 concurrent publishers, 10KB events |
| **Optimal Balance** | 16,714.00 events/sec @ 128.38 MB/sec | 10 concurrent publishers, 2KB events |

### Query Performance

| Query Type | Avg Rate | Notes |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Light Load** | 16.35 queries/sec | 50 queries after 1K events |
| **Medium Load** | 11.21 queries/sec | 100 queries after 10K events |
| **Heavy Load** | 5.53 queries/sec | 200 queries after 50K events |
| **Sustained** | 6.72 queries/sec | 500 continuous queries |

## Key Findings

1. **Optimal Concurrency**: The relay performs best with 10-50 concurrent publishers, achieving rates of 16,000-21,000 events/second.

2. **Event Size Impact**: 
   - Smaller events (512B-2KB) achieve higher event rates
   - Larger events (10KB) achieve higher bandwidth utilization but lower event rates

3. **Query Performance**: Query performance varies with database size:
   - Fresh database: ~16 queries/second
   - After 50K events: ~6 queries/second

4. **Scalability**: The relay maintains consistent performance up to 50 concurrent connections and can sustain 21,000+ events/second under optimal conditions.

## Query Filter Distribution

The benchmark tested 5 different query patterns in rotation:
1. Query by kind (20%)
2. Query by time range (20%)
3. Query by tag (20%)
4. Query by author (20%)
5. Complex queries with multiple conditions (20%)

All query types showed similar performance characteristics, indicating well-balanced indexing.
